## Project Motivation and Background
A a research group specializing in atmospheric chemistry at the University of British Columbia came up with a novel technique called the 'Bead Mobility Technique' for measuring the highly viscous fluids (up to ~10<sup>3</sup> Pas) and requiring only very small sample sizes (~1&mu;L). This technique was being applied to measure the viscocity of alpha-pinene particles which play a large role in global climate modeling due to their ability to act as cloud condensation nuclei. Their ability to act as these condensation nuclei is stringly related to their viscocity however before this technique, this data was not readily available, leaving a large knowledge gap in the input to global climate modeling thus restricting their accuracy. 

The experiment however was subject to large errors. The goal of this reserach based thesis was to approach the experient from a fluid flow perspective using Compuatational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to try and find and address the sources of the error(s).

## Thesis
The thesis is divided into the following major sections:
1. Research and Literature Review
- A summary of atmospheric aerosols and their role as cloud condensation nuclei
- A thorough investigation of current viscometer techniques
- Details of the Bead Mobility Technique (the experiment this thesis sought to improve)
2. Theoretical Calculations
- Formulation of a mathematical model of the fluid flow in the Bead Mobility Technique
- Used as benchmark during model development alongside experimental results
3. Model Development
- Details of model design and validation studies
4. Flow Analysis
- Utilizing the model created and compares results to literature findings and our previously created mathematical model
- Sets up the main variables by which the experiment improvements will be evaluated
5. Parametric Studies
- Investigates the suspected causes of experimental error and their relative impact on accuracy.
